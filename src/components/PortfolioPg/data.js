The Cell-Matrix centre is comprised of 30 research groups that broadly work on three distinct research areas: Mechano-matrix, Immuno-matrix, and Chrono-matrix. Therefore the idea behind the posters was to highlight these three areas in a visually compelling way while also providing more technical depth by the inclusion of graphical abstracts describing a selection of the research that has been carried out by the groups at the centre.'
