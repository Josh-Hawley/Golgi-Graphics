    description: "Welcome! I'm Dr. Josh Hawley, a passionate advocate for the fusion of science and design. With a background in Quantitative and Biophysical Biology at The University of Manchester, I have honed my expertise in understanding the intricacies of mathematically modelling biological systems, with a focus on embryonic development. \n However, my curiosity extends beyond just doing the science and as a graphic designer, I channel my creativity and love for aesthetics to convey the complexity of science in visually appealing and easy-to-understand graphics. I believe that bridging the gap between science and art is crucial for fostering scientific literacy and engaging a broader audience, as well as communicating amongst scientific peers. ",
